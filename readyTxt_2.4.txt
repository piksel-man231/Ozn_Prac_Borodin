 PYTOHN PYTOHN lewdness alluded PYTOHN by PYTOHN Quranic passages was attempted sodomy specifically

 Shakir In PYTOHN exegetical Islamic literature this verse has provided PYTOHN basis PYTOHN PYTOHN
 view PYTOHN Muhammad took PYTOHN lenient approach towards male homosexual practices The
 Orientalist scholar Pinhas Ben Nahum has argued PYTOHN it PYTOHN obvious PYTOHN PYTOHN Prophet
 viewed PYTOHN vice with philosophic indifference Not only PYTOHN PYTOHN punishment not indicatedit
 was probably some public reproach or insult PYTOHN PYTOHN slight naturebut mere penitence sufficed
 PYTOHN escape PYTOHN punishment Most exegetes hold PYTOHN these verses refer PYTOHN illicit

 scholar Abu Muslim alIsfahani interpreted them PYTOHN referring PYTOHN homosexual relations This
 view was widely rejected by medieval scholars but has found some acceptance PYTOHN modern times
 Cupbearers PYTOHN paradise Some Quranic verses describing PYTOHN paradise refer PYTOHN immortal
 boys or young men who serve wine PYTOHN PYTOHN blessed Although PYTOHN tafsir literature does not
 interpret this PYTOHN PYTOHN homoerotic allusion PYTOHN connection was made PYTOHN other literary
 genres mostly humorously For example PYTOHN Abbasidera poet Abu Nuwas wrote A beautiful lad came

 paradise And his eyes are big PYTOHN beautiful Jurists PYTOHN PYTOHN Hanafi school took up PYTOHN
 question seriously considering but ultimately rejecting PYTOHN suggestion PYTOHN homosexual
 pleasures were like wine forbidden PYTOHN this world but enjoyed PYTOHN PYTOHN afterlife In PYTOHN
 hadith The hadith sayings PYTOHN actions attributed PYTOHN Muhammad show PYTOHN homosexual

 PYTOHN nothing I fear PYTOHN my followers more than PYTOHN deed PYTOHN PYTOHN people PYTOHN Lot
 AlTirmidhi Ibn Maajah Other hadiths seem PYTOHN permit homoerotic feelings PYTOHN long PYTOHN they
 are not translated into action In one hadith attributed PYTOHN Muhammad himself which exists
 PYTOHN multiple variants PYTOHN Islamic prophet acknowledged homoerotic temptation towards young
 boys PYTOHN warned his Companions against it Do not gaze at PYTOHN beardless youths PYTOHN verily
 they have eyes more tempting than PYTOHN houris or PYTOHN verily they resemble PYTOHN houris These
 beardless youths are also described PYTOHN wearing sumptuous robes PYTOHN having perfumed hair
 Consequently Islamic religious leaders skeptical PYTOHN Muslim mens capacity PYTOHN selfcontrol

 addition there PYTOHN PYTOHN number PYTOHN purported but mutually inconsistent reports athar
 PYTOHN punishments PYTOHN sodomy ordered by some PYTOHN PYTOHN early caliphs Abu Bakr apparently
 recommended toppling PYTOHN wall on PYTOHN culprit or else burning him alive while Ali ibn Abi

 thrown headfirst from PYTOHN top PYTOHN PYTOHN highest building PYTOHN PYTOHN town according
 PYTOHN Ibn Abbas PYTOHN latter punishment must be followed by stoning There are however fewer

 PYTOHN PYTOHN sexual orientation since PYTOHN latter concept PYTOHN modern PYTOHN has no match
 PYTOHN traditional law which dealt with it under PYTOHN technical terms PYTOHN liwat PYTOHN zina
 Broadly traditional Islamic law took PYTOHN view PYTOHN homosexual activity could not be legally
 sanctioned because it takes place outside religiouslyrecognised marriages All major schools PYTOHN
 law consider liwat anal sex PYTOHN PYTOHN punishable offence Most legal schools treat homosexual
 intercourse with penetration similarly PYTOHN unlawful heterosexual intercourse under PYTOHN
 rubric PYTOHN zina but there are differences PYTOHN opinion with respect PYTOHN methods PYTOHN
 punishment Some legal schools prescribed capital punishment PYTOHN sodomy but others opted only
 PYTOHN PYTOHN relatively mild discretionary punishment The Hanbalites are PYTOHN most severe among

 schools generally restrict punishment PYTOHN flagellation with or without banishment unless PYTOHN

 Hanafi school Abu Hanifa refused PYTOHN recognize PYTOHN analogy between sodomy PYTOHN zina
 although his two principal students disagreed with him on this point The Hanafi scholar Abu Bakr
 AlJassas d AD AH argued PYTOHN PYTOHN two hadiths on killing homosexuals are not reliable by any
 means PYTOHN no legal punishment can be prescribed based on them Where capital punishment PYTOHN
 prescribed PYTOHN PYTOHN particular method PYTOHN recommended PYTOHN methods range from stoning
 Hanbali Maliki PYTOHN PYTOHN sword some Hanbalites PYTOHN Shafiites or leaving it PYTOHN PYTOHN

 PYTOHN tendency PYTOHN indulgence PYTOHN some recommend PYTOHN PYTOHN prescribed penalty should
 not be applied PYTOHN full with Ibn Hazm reducing PYTOHN number PYTOHN strokes PYTOHN There was
 debate PYTOHN PYTOHN whether PYTOHN active PYTOHN passive partners PYTOHN anal sex should be
 punished equally Beyond penetrative anal sex there was general agreement PYTOHN other homosexual
 acts including any between females were lesser offenses subject only PYTOHN discretionary
 punishment Some jurists viewed sexual intercourse PYTOHN possible only PYTOHN an individual who
 possesses PYTOHN phallus hence those definitions PYTOHN sexual intercourse PYTOHN rely on PYTOHN
 entry PYTOHN PYTOHN little PYTOHN PYTOHN corona PYTOHN PYTOHN phallus into PYTOHN partners orifice
 Since women do not possess PYTOHN phallus PYTOHN cannot have intercourse with one another they are
 PYTOHN this interpretation physically incapable PYTOHN committing zin Practicality Since PYTOHN

 homosexuality In Kugles reading PYTOHN Quran holds PYTOHN positive assessment PYTOHN diversity It
 respects diversity PYTOHN physical appearance constitution stature PYTOHN color PYTOHN human
 beings PYTOHN PYTOHN natural consequence PYTOHN Divine wisdom PYTOHN creation Therefore Islam can
 be described PYTOHN PYTOHN religion PYTOHN positively assesses diversity PYTOHN creation PYTOHN
 PYTOHN human societies Furthermore PYTOHN Kugles reading PYTOHN Quran implies PYTOHN some people
 are different PYTOHN their sexual desires than others Thus homosexuality can be seen PYTOHN part
 PYTOHN PYTOHN natural diversity PYTOHN sexuality PYTOHN human societies This PYTOHN PYTOHN way gay
 PYTOHN lesbian Muslims view their homosexuality In addition PYTOHN PYTOHN Quran Kugle refers
 PYTOHN PYTOHN benediction PYTOHN Imam AlGhazali PYTOHN thcentury Muslim theologian which says
 praise be PYTOHN God PYTOHN marvels PYTOHN whose creation are not subject PYTOHN PYTOHN arrows
 PYTOHN accident For Kugle this benediction implies PYTOHN if sexuality PYTOHN inherent PYTOHN
 PYTOHN persons personality then sexual diversity PYTOHN PYTOHN part PYTOHN creation which PYTOHN
 never accidental but PYTOHN always marvelous Kugle also refers PYTOHN PYTOHN rich archive PYTOHN
 samesex sexual desires PYTOHN expressions written by or reported about respected members PYTOHN

 PYTOHN one might consider Islamic societies like classical Greece PYTOHN provide PYTOHN vivid
 illustration PYTOHN PYTOHN homosexualfriendly environment This evoked from medieval PYTOHN early
 modern Christian Europeans accusations PYTOHN Muslim were engaging openly PYTOHN samesex practices
 Kugle goes PYTOHN step further PYTOHN his argument PYTOHN asserts PYTOHN if some Muslims find it
 necessary PYTOHN deny PYTOHN sexual diversity PYTOHN part PYTOHN PYTOHN natural created world then
 PYTOHN burden PYTOHN proof rests on their shoulders PYTOHN illustrate their denial from PYTOHN

 says PYTOHN male desire PYTOHN penetrate desirable youth was perfectly normal Even if samesex
 relations were not lawful there was an unwillingness PYTOHN seek out PYTOHN condemn instances
 PYTOHN samesex activity but rather PYTOHN let them pass by unpunished   Ali states PYTOHN some
